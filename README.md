# Digital Thermostat Controller (VHDL)
This repository contains the VHDL design for a simple, digital thermostat controller. This design demonstrates fundamental digital logic concepts, including combinational logic, conditional statements, and binary comparison.

### Design Files
* therm.vhd: The main VHDL source code for the thermostat component. This file describes the combinational logic that governs the system's behavior.
