# Digital Thermostat Controller (VHDL)
This repository contains the VHDL design for a simple, digital thermostat controller. This design demonstrates fundamental digital logic concepts, including combinational logic, conditional statements, and binary comparison.

### Design Files
* therm.vhd: The main VHDL source code for the thermostat component.
* test_thermo.vhd: The VHDL test bench that simulates the therm component. It applies a series of inputs to verify that the thermostat behaves as expected under different conditions.
